# Data Clustering Using Path Lengths

Included in this repository are two earlier versions of a paper entitled "High Dimensional Cluster Analysis Using Path Lengths".  The first version is 52 pages long (unabridged) and has been previously posted on Arxiv.org.  The second version is 22 pages long, cutting out most of the appendix discussion about the details of the local maxima finding routine, as well as some additional figures in the main body of the text describing how to take a data set in multiple dimensions and reduce to a set of partitions.

A code repository is present in SPEMS16_TEMPLATE.zip.   Over time, the code in this archive will be better commented and explained.  For now, the file is largely a placeholder.
